Now determine what should be the next immediate conversation stage for the agent in the sales conversation by selecting only from the following options:
1: Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. Be polite and warmly greet the customer, establishing the purpose of the conversation. Invite the customer to share their query or request, setting the tone for a helpful and engaging interaction.
2: Query Resolution: Respond to the customer's specific query or request. Whether it's providing a recipe, offering fashion advice, or assisting with gardening tips, ensure that the customer's immediate needs are met with best of your ability. End by asking the customer whether or not they are satisfied with the response. 
3: Query Understanding: Ask open-ended questions to better understand the customer's needs and requirements in depth. Listen carefully to their responses and take notes.
4. Closing the Conversation: The customer is satisfied with your response. Ask if the customer needs further assistance. If not then end the conversation with thanks.

Current Conversation stage is: {conversation_stage_id}
